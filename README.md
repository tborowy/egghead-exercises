#Exercise 6: Angular ng-repeat and filtering data

##Summary
In this application, you are supposed to create `searchStudent` filter allowing user to search through the list of students by filtering the specified field.

##Goals
Your task is to make the `search` input field search through all categories. Each input field is responsible for its own column. Furthermore, you should be able
 to filter by using multiple fields at the same time.

 * write `Warner` in `First Name` field

| firstName | lastName |age |email|phone|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Warner  |Bridges| 18|warner.bridges@undefined.biz|+1 (914) 451-3055|

 * write `1` in `Age` field

| firstName | lastName |age |email|phone|
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Warner  |Bridges| 18|warner.bridges@undefined.biz|+1 (914) 451-3055|
| Gray  |Rose| 21|gray.rose@undefined.io|+1 (807) 582-3992|
