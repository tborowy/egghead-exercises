##Exercise 40 : angular.copy

##Summary
In this application something bad happened to the titles of images. Use `selectedReq`, `requirementCopy` angular variables and `angular.copy` to update data 
after you click on the image.


##Goals

Complete and use `update`, `save` functions to achieve the following results:

* click on the image should cause the appearance of **update input**
* enter text into the input should **not** automatically change the title of the image
* after clicking `Save` button title of the image is updated

##Before you start, please refer to:

```
