#Exercise 2 : Controller

##Summary
Applications often need to display value that user has entered. You are provided with simple view containing title, three inputs and display board. Your task is to
implement functionality that will allow inputs to be displayed along with the information on the title and board.

##Goals
* create **FruitCtrl** file with `FruitCtrl` controller belonging to `app` module
* in controller add three properties: `seller, name, count` with default values set to : **"Mr. John"**, **"apple"** and **3**.
* comments in `index.html` should be replaced with appropriate values from the inputs

##Before you start, please refer to:
