##Exercise 59: Accessing Data in HTML

##Summary
Use your knowledge of the good and the bad practices about accessing Data in HTML and update `transport.js` file.
You will find there information about three different modes of transport departure (`bus`, `train` and `plains`). You can update **via stop** bus, add 
**delay** to trains departure and **cancel** flights.

##Goals
* remember to add necessary services and controllers (train and bus)
* avoid using **$scope** and **$rootScope**
* the application should work the same after changes
* names new controllers and services should be similar to existing ones

##Before you start:
* [angularjs-accessing-data-in-html](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-accessing-data-in-html)

##Setup
 You should have installed `npm`, `bower`, `grunt-cli`  packages to run this example. To resolve dependencies run:

```
npm install
```

```
bower install
```

To run the application:

```
grunt serve
```

To run cucumber tests:

```
grunt test
```

To run unit tests:

Good luck!
